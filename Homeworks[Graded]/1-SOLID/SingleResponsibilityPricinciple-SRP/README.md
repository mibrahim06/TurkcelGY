Single Responsibility Principle

The SRP means that a single class should have a single responsibility. 
This means that a class should have only one reason to change.

There is a quote from Robert C. Martin(Originator of the single responsibility principle) that says:
"There should be never more than one reason for a class to change."

Why that principle exists?
- To make our classes more reusable and create more flexible and maintainable code.
- To make our code more readable and understandable. Fewer responsibilities mean fewer dependencies. 
- To make our code more testable.
